## Data Loading

We will use Python and the `pandas` library to load and manipulate the World Development Indicators dataset for 2022. 

```{python}
#| echo: true
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
wdi = pd.read_csv('wdi.csv')

```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

To better understand the global landscape in 2022, we will focus our exploratory data analysis on three key indicators: 

1. **GDP per capita** (`gdp_per_capita`): A measure of economic output per person.
2. **Life expectancy** (`life_expectancy`): A core measure of public health and longevity.
3. **Unemployment rate** (`unemployment_rate`): An indicator of labor market health and economic stability.

### Summary Statistics and Data Quality

First, let's examine the descriptive statistics and check for any missing data within these three columns. By setting `#| echo: true`, we ensure the code is visible in our final report.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| label: eda-stats

import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('wdi.csv')

# Define our three chosen indicators
target_vars = ['gdp_per_capita', 'life_expectancy', 'unemployment_rate']

# Generate and print descriptive statistics
print("--- Summary Statistics ---")
print(df[target_vars].describe().round(2))

print("\n--- Missing Values Count ---")
print(df[target_vars].isna().sum())

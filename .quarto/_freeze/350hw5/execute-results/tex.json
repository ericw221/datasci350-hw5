We will conduct an exploratory data analysis focusing on three key variables: GDP per capita, life expectancy, and unemployment rate. The relationship between national income and population health is a foundational concept in demographic economics [@preston1975]. Furthermore, labor market stability plays a critical role in public health, as widespread unemployment has been consistently linked to higher mortality rates [@roelfs2011]. By visualizing these metrics, we aim to highlight the current state of global disparities.\n\n\n## Data Loading\n\nWe will use Python and the `pandas` library to load and manipulate the World Development Indicators dataset for 2022. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the dataset\nwdi = pd.read_csv('wdi.csv')\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nTo better understand the global landscape in 2022, we will focus our exploratory data analysis on three key indicators: \n\n1. **GDP per capita** (`gdp_per_capita`): A measure of economic output per person.\n2. **Life expectancy** (`life_expectancy`): A core measure of public health and longevity.\n3. **Unemployment rate** (`unemployment_rate`): An indicator of labor market health and economic stability.\n\nFirst, let's examine the descriptive statistics and check for any missing data within these three columns. \n\n::: {#eda-stats .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntarget_vars = ['gdp_per_capita', 'life_expectancy', 'unemployment_rate']\n\nprint(wdi[target_vars].describe().round(2))\n\nprint(wdi[target_vars].isna().sum())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n       gdp_per_capita  life_expectancy  unemployment_rate\ncount          203.00           209.00             186.00\nmean         20345.71            72.42               7.27\nstd          31308.94             7.71               5.83\nmin            259.03            53.00               0.13\n25%           2570.56            66.78               3.50\n50%           7587.59            73.51               5.54\n75%          25982.63            78.47               9.46\nmax         240862.18            85.38              37.85\ngdp_per_capita       14\nlife_expectancy       8\nunemployment_rate    31\ndtype: int64\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Visualizations\n\nTo further analyze our selected indicators, we can visualize their relationships and distributions. \n\nFirst, we will look at the relationship between a country's wealth (GDP per capita) and the health of its citizens (life expectancy). \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Scatter plot illustrating the positive relationship between GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy. Data source: World Bank World Development Indicators (2022)](350hw5_files/figure-pdf/fig-wealth-health-output-1.pdf){#fig-wealth-health}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe scatter plot above demonstrates a clear trend in that life expecatancy is positively correlated with GDP per Capita. Higher GDP generally is associated with higher life expectancy, although it seems to level off at the upper end, forming a logistic curve.\n\nNext, we examine the labor market by highlighting the countries that experienced the highest unemployment rates in 2022.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Bar chart displaying the 15 countries with the highest reported unemployment rates. Data source: World Bank World Development Indicators (2022)](350hw5_files/figure-pdf/fig-unemployment-output-1.pdf){#fig-unemployment}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis bar chart highlights the nations facing the most severe labor market challenges, with several countries experiencing unemployment rates exceeding 20%.\n\n### Key Statistics Summary\n\nTo consolidate our findings, we can extract the global averages and extremes for our selected indicators. \n\n::: {#tbl-key-stats .cell tbl-cap='Global Mean, Minimum, and Maximum values for GDP, Life Expectancy, and Unemployment (2022).' execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display .cell-output-markdown execution_count=10}\n|      |   GDP per Capita (US$) |   Life Expectancy (Years) |   Unemployment Rate (%) |\n|:-----|-----------------------:|--------------------------:|------------------------:|\n| mean |               20345.7  |                     72.42 |                    7.27 |\n| min  |                 259.03 |                     53    |                    0.13 |\n| max  |              240862    |                     85.38 |                   37.85 |\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs detailed in @tbl-key-stats, the global average life expectancy is approximately 72 years, but the minimum drops down to roughly 53 years. This severe disparity in health outcomes is closely tied to economic standing, which we visualized earlier in @fig-wealth-health. That scatter plot clearly demonstrates that nations with higher economic output tend to secure much longer life expectancies for their citizens.\n\nFurthermore, global economic stability varies wildly. While the average global unemployment rate sits around 7% (@tbl-key-stats), our bar chart analysis in @fig-unemployment highlights that several nations faced staggering unemployment crises, with rates exceeding 20% to 30% of their total labor force in 2022.\n\n## References\n\n",
